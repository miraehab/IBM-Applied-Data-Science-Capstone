<h1>New Rocket Company Project <img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/rocket.png" width=55/></h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
Worked on a new rocket company named "SpaceY" that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk.
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. to compete with SpaceX we need to understand these informations.

<h2>Project Steps:</h2>

1. Collected the rocket launch data from the SpaceX API --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/collectingTheData.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
2. Web-scraped the SpaceX table in the wikipedia page to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/collectingTheData-webscraping.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
3. Performed some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Data%20wrangling.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
4. Built an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash to find some geographical patterns about launch sites. --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/site_location.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
5. Implemented the machine learning classification model to predict if a rocket will land successfuly or not using logistic regression, KNN, desision tree and support vector machine. --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
