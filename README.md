<h1>New Rocket Company Project <img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/rocket.png" width=55/></h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
Worked on a new rocket company named "SpaceY" that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk.
Using the different Data Science techniques to gathere information about Space X and create dashboards and use machine learning to determine the price of each launch, predict if the first stage will land sccessfully and predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

<h2>Project Steps:</h2>

1. Collected the rocket launch data from the SpaceX API --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/collectingTheData.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
2. Web-scraped the SpaceX table in the wikipedia page to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/collectingTheData-webscraping.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
3. Perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models --> <a href="https://github.com/miraehab/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Data%20wrangling.ipynb">NoteBook</a>
